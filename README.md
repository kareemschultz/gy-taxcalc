## 📊 Calculation Details

### **Tax Calculation Method**
1. **Gross Income**: Basic salary + taxable allowances + additional income
2. **Deductions Applied**: Income tax threshold, NIS, child allowances, insurance
3. **Taxable Income**: Gross income minus all applicable deductions
4. **Tax Calculation**: 25% up to $280,000, then 35% on the remainder
5. **Net Salary**: Gross income minus NIS, tax, and other deductions

### **Gratuity Calculation**
- **Accrual Rate**: 22.5% of basic salary per month
- **Payment Schedule**: Typically every 6 months
- **Tax Status**: Non-taxable income
- **Annual Total**: Usually equals 2.7 months of basic salary (22.5% × 12 months)

### **Frequency Adjustments**
All tax thresholds, allowances, and deductions are automatically converted based on payment frequency:
- **Income Tax Threshold**: $140,000 monthly → $32,333 weekly → $6,460 daily
- **Tax Thresholds**: Proportionally adjusted for each frequency
- **NIS Ceilings**: Scaled appropriately for payment periods

## 🔧 Customization

### **Adding New Position Presets**
Edit `js/constants.js` to add new positions:
```javascript
const POSITION_PRESETS = {
    'your-position-id': {
        title: 'Your Position Title',
        baseSalary: 250000,
        taxableAllowances: { /* ... */ },
        nonTaxableAllowances: { /* ... */ }
    }
};
```

### **Modifying Tax Rates**
Update tax constants in `js/constants.js`:
```javascript
const TAX_RATE_1 = 0.25; // 25%
const TAX_RATE_2 = 0.35; // 35%
const TAX_THRESHOLD = 280000; // Monthly threshold
```

### **Theme Customization**
Modify CSS custom properties in `css/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #1e40af;
    --background: #f9fafb;
    /* ... other variables */
}
```
